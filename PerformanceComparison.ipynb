    "## Dataset Generation for Benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we generate synthetic datasets to evaluate the performance differences between pandas and polars when handling DataFrames. A systematic benchmarking approach requires datasets of varying sizes and characteristics, allowing us to measure the performance impact of different data operations under various conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets generated here are designed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simulate Realistic Data Patterns**: We include numerical, textual, and date columns to mimic the diverse types of data typically handled in data processing tasks.\n",
    "2. **Scale Across Different Sizes**: By generating datasets with increasing numbers of rows (from thousands to millions), we can observe how well each library handles different data volumes.\n",
    "3. **Provide Incremental Samples per Size Category**: For each predefined size (e.g., 10,000 rows, 1 million rows), we create multiple datasets with a slightly increasing number of rows. This approach allows us to evaluate performance on a finer scale, capturing how incremental data increases affect each libraryâ€™s efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset has:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A combination of numeric, string, and datetime columns to represent different data types.\n",
    "    Rows increasing progressively by a percentage of the base size, allowing for a more granular benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets will be saved as CSV files named in the format {number_of_rows}_{number_of_columns}.csv and stored in the datasets directory for easy access during our benchmarking process."
